# SkiaSharp Animated Backgrounds

A .NET implementation of https://github.com/AndreBaltazar8/flutter_animated_background

I am not biased ðŸ˜œ but ovbiously Xamarin and .NET requires much less code - and none of that weird UI strings mid-code.

Not sure where this is going, but seems to work just fine.

And, some screenshots... Of course there is a few more platforms that I could have shown, but haven't gotten arounds to that just yet.
