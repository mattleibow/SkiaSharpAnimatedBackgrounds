# SkiaSharp Animated Backgrounds

A .NET implementation of https://github.com/AndreBaltazar8/flutter_animated_background

I am not biased ðŸ˜œ but ovbiously Xamarin and .NET requires much less code - and none of that weird UI strings mid-code.

Not sure where this is going, but seems to work just fine.

And, some screenshots... _of course, there are a few more platforms that I still need to add to the repo and include screenshots for._
